The landscape of modern software development is characterized by a relentless drive for rapid innovation and deployment. In this high-velocity environment, the responsibility for writing secure code has decisively shifted from being the exclusive domain of specialized security teams to a core competency required of all software developers. This paradigm, widely known as "shift-left" security or DevSecOps, advocates for the integration of security practices at the earliest stages of the development lifecycle. The fundamental principle is that building security in from the start is vastly more effective and less costly than attempting to bolt it on as an afterthought. By embedding security directly into the developer\'s daily workflow, the goal is to foster a culture where security is not a gatekeeper, but a shared responsibility and an integral measure of software quality.

However, the practical realization of this vision is often hindered by significant obstacles. One of the most pervasive challenges is the prevalence of what can be described as intuition-based developmentâ€”an approach where code is written based on surface-level functionality ("it feels right") without being subjected to rigorous, systematic security analysis. This practice, while often unintentional and driven by tight deadlines, creates a fertile ground for subtle and dangerous vulnerabilities to take root in the codebase. These vulnerabilities, ranging from common injection flaws to complex authentication bypasses, can remain dormant and undetected, only to be discovered after deployment when the cost and impact of remediation are at their highest.

The problem is further compounded by the fragmented and often unwieldy nature of the existing security tooling ecosystem. While a plethora of powerful tools exist for static analysis (SAST), dependency checking, and dynamic analysis (DAST), they are typically disparate, single-purpose utilities. A developer seeking to comprehensively secure their application might need to juggle a static analyzer like Bandit for Python, a multi-language tool like Semgrep for custom rule-based scanning, and a web scanner like shcheck for server configuration validation. Each tool comes with its own unique command-line interface, configuration syntax, and output format. This lack of a unified, cohesive experience creates significant friction, disrupts the development workflow, and ultimately acts as a barrier to the widespread adoption of secure coding habits.

This thesis confronts this challenge directly by proposing the design, implementation, and evaluation of a unified, developer-centric security toolkit. The central artifact of this research is an extensible command-line interface (CLI) application, architected in the Python programming language for its extensive libraries and ease of development. This toolkit is not intended to reinvent the wheel, but rather to act as a powerful, cohesive orchestrator for a variety of security modules. The implementation integrates multiple scanning approaches into a single CLI-driven workflow, including a static analysis engine for Python source code, a dependency scanner using pip-audit, and a configuration scanner for common framework files.

A key innovation of this project is the development of a companion Visual Studio Code (VS Code) extension. This extension will bridge the critical gap between security analysis and the development environment by providing real-time, contextual feedback directly within the developer\'s editor. By surfacing vulnerabilities and misconfigurations as they are introduced, the toolkit aims to transform security from a delayed, out-of-band process into an immediate and integral part of the coding experience. The overarching goal is to create a tool that is not only powerful and accurate but also intuitive and unobtrusive, thereby lowering the barrier to entry for secure development practices and empowering developers to build more secure software by default.

This thesis is structured to provide a comprehensive account of the research and its outcomes. Chapter 2 offers a thorough literature review of the current landscape of developer security tooling. Chapter 3 provides an overview of existing security tools and differentiates the developed toolkit. Chapter 4 details the OWASP Top 10 framework which serves as the foundation for the scanner's rules. Chapter 5 describes the system architecture and implementation of the core CLI tool. Chapter 6 details the development of the companion VS Code extension. Chapter 7 presents the evaluation methodology and results, comparing the toolkit's two scanning engines against vulnerable applications. Finally, Chapter 8 concludes the thesis with a summary of the findings, a discussion of the project's limitations, and a roadmap for future work.
