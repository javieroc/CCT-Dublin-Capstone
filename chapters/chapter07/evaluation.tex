\section{Web Frameworks: Django and Flask}

Before diving into the case studies, it is important to understand the web frameworks they are built on: Django and Flask. Both are popular Python web frameworks, but they have different design philosophies and are used for different types of projects. This makes them excellent choices for testing the versatility and effectiveness of a security scanner.

\subsection*{Django}
Django is a high-level, "batteries-included" web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. It provides a large number of built-in features, such as an object-relational mapper (ORM), a powerful templating engine, and a comprehensive security module. By testing on Django projects like PyGoat and django.nV, we can evaluate the scanner's ability to detect vulnerabilities in a complex, feature-rich environment. This includes testing for common Django-specific vulnerabilities, such as cross-site request forgery (CSRF) and insecure direct object references (IDORs), as well as more general security issues.

\subsection*{Flask}
Flask is a lightweight, "micro" web framework that provides the bare essentials for building a web application. It is designed to be simple, flexible, and easy to extend. Flask's minimalism gives developers more control over the components they use, but it also places a greater responsibility on them to ensure the security of their application. By testing on a Flask project like VAmPI, we can evaluate the scanner's ability to detect vulnerabilities in a more minimalistic and customizable environment. This is particularly relevant for testing the detection of security misconfigurations and vulnerabilities that arise from the use of third-party libraries.

By testing on projects built with both Django and Flask, we can ensure that the security scanner is effective across a wide range of Python web applications, from large, monolithic applications to small, lightweight microservices. This demonstrates the scanner's versatility and its ability to adapt to different development styles and project requirements.

\subsection{Case Studies}

\subsubsection{PyGoat}
PyGoat is an intentionally insecure web application developed by OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project). It is built using the \textbf{Django} framework for Python. The primary purpose of PyGoat is to provide a realistic, yet vulnerable, environment for developers and security professionals to learn about and test for web application vulnerabilities. It covers a wide range of security issues, with a focus on the OWASP Top Ten. The official GitHub repository for PyGoat is \url{https://github.com/OWASP/www-project-pygoat}.

\subsubsection{VAmPI}
VAmPI (Vulnerable API) is a vulnerable REST API created with the \textbf{Flask} micro-framework for Python. It is specifically designed to demonstrate the vulnerabilities listed in the OWASP Top 10 for APIs. VAmPI is an excellent tool for learning about API security and for evaluating the effectiveness of API security scanners. It features a switch to enable or disable vulnerabilities, which is useful for testing purposes. The project's GitHub repository can be found at \url{https://github.com/erev0s/VAmPI}.

\subsubsection{django.nV}
django.nV is an intentionally vulnerable web application built with the \textbf{Django} framework. It was originally created by nVisium (now part of NetSPI) as a training tool for developers to learn about common security vulnerabilities in Django applications. The application is a simple project management tool with various security flaws, such as those from the OWASP Top Ten, waiting to be discovered and fixed. The GitHub repository for django.nV is \url{https://github.com/NetSPI/django.nV}.
