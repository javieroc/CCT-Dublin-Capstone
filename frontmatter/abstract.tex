\chapter{Abstract}
\begin{SingleSpace}
This project involved the design and development of an extensible, security-focused toolkit for software developers. The core artifact is a command-line interface (CLI) application built in Rust, integrating multiple security analysis capabilities into a single, cohesive framework. Key modules include a static code analyzer for detecting insecure programming patterns in Python and an HTTPS header scanner for evaluating web server security configurations.

To enhance developer workflow, the CLI toolkit is complemented by a Visual Studio Code (VS Code) extension that delivers real-time, in-editor feedback. The system's modular architecture, guided by standards like the OWASP Top 10 and CERT guidelines, allows for future expansion with new scanners and linters.

This work addresses the fragmentation and lack of developer-friendly integration common in existing security tools. By embedding security checks directly into the development environment, the toolkit promotes the adoption of secure programming practices. The solution was evaluated against established tools like Bandit and Semgrep using real-world insecure codebases and misconfigured servers. The final deliverables include the CLI tool, the VS Code extension, and comprehensive documentation, demonstrating a practical approach to shifting security left in the development lifecycle.
